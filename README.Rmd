# extrachecks

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of extrachecks is to help you ensure that you pass common manual checks that the CRAN
team do that are not automated. 

Inspired by [DavisVaughan/extrachecks](https://github.com/DavisVaughan/extrachecks) and my own frustration in publishing packages to CRAN.

## Installation

You can install the development version of extrachecks from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
if (!requires("remotes") install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JosiahParry/extrachecks")
```

## Example

Run the extra checks. 

```{r}
extrachecks::extrachecks()
```
