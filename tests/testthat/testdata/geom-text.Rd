\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[=aes]{aes()}}. If specified and
\code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the default), it is combined with the default mapping
at the top level of the plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot
mapping.}

\item{size.unit}{How the \code{size} aesthetic is interpreted: as millimetres
(\code{"mm"}, default), points (\code{"pt"}), centimetres (\code{"cm"}), inches (\code{"in"}),
or picas (\code{"pc"}).}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[=borders]{borders()}}.}

\section{Aesthetics}{

\code{geom_text()} understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in bold)

\examples{
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, label = rownames(mtcars)))

p + geom_text()

\dontrun{
# Doesn't work on all systems
p +
  geom_text(family = "Times New Roman")

# Aligning labels and bars --------------------------------------------------
df <- data.frame(
  x = factor(c(1, 1, 2, 2)),
  y = c(1, 3, 2, 1),
  grp = c("a", "b", "a", "b")
)

}
